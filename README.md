# OSINT-StressForge

OSINT-StressForge is a lightweight stress testing toolkit designed to push OSINT (Open-Source Intelligence) tools to their limits.  
It helps identify bugs, performance bottlenecks, and stability issues under extreme conditions.


## Features
- **Input Overload Testing** – Feeds large datasets and extreme values to the tool.
- **Concurrency Testing** – Simulates multiple users or processes running at the same time.
- **Fuzz Testing** – Sends malformed, random, or corrupted inputs to trigger edge-case bugs.
- **Resource Monitoring** – Tracks CPU and memory usage during testing.
- **Logging & Reporting** – Saves error logs and generates summary reports.

## Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/OSINT-StressForge.git
cd OSINT-StressForge
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


## Usage
- Replace the `TARGET_URL` in `stress_test.py` with your OSINT tool endpoint (or modify to call a local function).
- Run:
  - `python3 stress_test.py`
- Results:
  - Error logs: `logs/error_log.txt`
  - Resource usage: `logs/resource_usage.log`
  - Summary: `reports/results_summary.json`


## Dependencies
- requests - For API testing
- psutil - For monitoring system recourses


## Legal Notice
- Use responsibly. Only test tools you own or have explicit permission to test.
